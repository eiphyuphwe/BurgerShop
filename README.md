# Technologies Used
- Kotlin: A modern statically typed programming language for multi-platform applications.
- Model View ViewModel (MVVM): An architectural pattern that separates the development of graphical user interfaces from the business logic.

- Dependency Injection (DI): Integrate a DI framework like Dagger or Hilt to manage dependencies and improve code modularity.
- Unit and UI Testing: Implement comprehensive unit and UI tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.
- Cache Feature: Add caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data locally, reducing network calls and improving app performance.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate build, testing, and deployment processes, ensuring faster and more reliable delivery of updates.
Infrastructure:
- API Migration: Develop a custom API to replace the current third-party API, providing more control and flexibility over data retrieval and management.
# Product Improvement:
New Features:
